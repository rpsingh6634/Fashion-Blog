                        The Taj Mahal represents the finest and most sophisticated example of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its origins lie in the moving circumstances of its commission and the culture and history of an Islamic Mughal empire's rule of large parts of India. The distraught Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned the project upon the death of one of his favorite wives Mumtaz Mahal.

                        The intervening years had seen Khurrum take two other wives known as Akbarabadi Mahal and Kandahari Mahal, but according to the official court chronicler Qazwini, the relationship with his other wives "had little more than the status of marriage.

                        Most Asian architecture was influenced by ancient religions, with influences from Hinduism and Buddhism becoming evident. ...

                        China is the largest single country in Asia, and its architectural influence overlaps current national borders. The ancient Chinese carved animals and creatures (such as dragons) into their temples and palaces, and they decorated many homes and public buildings with symbolic ornamentation. The revered ancient architect Li Jie wrote the textbook used to teach Chinese architecture for over 300 years called the Yingzao Fashi.

                           Like other aspects of the culture of Africa, the architecture of Africa is exceptionally diverse. Throughout the history of Africa, Africans have developed their own local architectural traditions. ... African architecture uses a wide range of materials, including thatch, stick/wood, mud, mudbrick, rammed earth, and stone.

                           Australian architecture has generally been consistent with architectural trends in the wider Western world, with some special adaptations to compensate for distinctive Australian climatic and cultural factors. Indigenous Australians produced a wide range of structures and places prior to colonisation.
