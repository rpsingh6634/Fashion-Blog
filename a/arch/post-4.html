                        From medieval monasteries and Renaissance castles to cutting-edge modern design, European architecture is the world's most varied – and it's all contained in such a small geographic area.

                        From the dramatic spires of Notre Dame to the fascinating history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, there’s so much to learn from European architecture. If you need help telling Romanesque from Renaissance, take a look at this handy guide to some of Europe’s most iconic architecture.

                        Architectural style: Ancient Greek - Doric, Ionic, Corinthian orders. Doric order is the least extravagant form of Ancient Greek architecture: the columns have no base and were not ornately decorated. Ionic order architecture is slightly more decorative with taller and thinner columns and ornate bases. Corinthian order architecture is similar to Ionic but the capitals (tops of columns) are even more ornate, decorated with designs such as leaves or floral patterns.

                        Planning and initial construction began under the guidance of the general and statesman Pericles of Athens. The first stone was laid on July 28th 447 BCE. The intention was to create a lasting monument to honour the goddess Athena and proclaim the glory of the city to the world.

                        Other buildings were added to the Acropolis by Roman Emperor Hadrian and with the rise of Christianity after Constantine the Great, the Pantheon became a church and the Acropolis was made into a centre of Christian devotion.

                        <p>
                           Most Asian architecture was influenced by ancient religions, with influences from Hinduism and Buddhism becoming evident. ... Buddhist temples include large open pavilions to accommodate prayer or meditation in large groups and are likely to incorporate acoustic elements into their design.

                           Like other aspects of the culture of Africa, the architecture of Africa is exceptionally diverse. Throughout the history of Africa, Africans have developed their own local architectural traditions. ...

                           Australian architecture has generally been consistent with architectural trends in the wider Western world, with some special adaptations to compensate for distinctive Australian climatic and cultural factors. Indigenous Australians produced a wide range of structures and places prior to colonisation.

                           The architecture used by the first settlers in North America is traditionally known as Colonial architecture. (See also: American Colonial Art.)
