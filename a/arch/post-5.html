                        The architecture used by the first settlers in North America is traditionally known as Colonial architecture. (See also: American Colonial Art.) This early architecture was as diverse as the settlers themselves, who included Spanish, English, Scots-Irish, Dutch, German, French and Swedish.

                        North America is an anachronism. Some structures in North America can however be classified as medieval, either by age or origin. In some rare cases these structures are seen as evidence on pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. Although much of this is pseudoscience, these buildings are of interest to American scholars of medieval architecture

                        Each group of immigrants brought with them the style and building practices of their mother country, adapting it to the conditions of their new homeland, as exemplified by the North European medieval Gothic design for village houses and barns. In all, there were about seven basic colonial designs.
