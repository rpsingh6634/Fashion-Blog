                     <p> 
                        A common theme in traditional African architecture is the use of fractal scaling: small parts of the structure tend to look similar to larger parts, such as a circular village made of circular houses.

                     <p>
                        African architecture in some areas has been influenced by external cultures for centuries, according to available evidence. Western architecture has influenced coastal areas since the late 15th century and is now an important source of inspiration for many larger buildings, particularly in major cities.

                     <p>
                        African architecture uses a wide range of materials, including thatch, stick/wood, mud, mudbrick, rammed earth, and stone. These material preferences vary by region: North Africa for stone and rammed earth, the Horn of Africa for stone and mortar, West Africa for mud/adobe, Central Africa for thatch/wood and more perishable materials, Southeast and Southern Africa for stone and thatch/wood.

                        <p>
                           Most Asian architecture was influenced by ancient religions, with influences from Hinduism and Buddhism becoming evident. ... Buddhist temples include large open pavilions to accommodate prayer or meditation in large groups and are likely to incorporate acoustic elements into their design.

                           Australian architecture has generally been consistent with architectural trends in the wider Western world, with some special adaptations to compensate for distinctive Australian climatic and cultural factors. Indigenous Australians produced a wide range of structures and places prior to colonisation.

                           The architecture used by the first settlers in North America is traditionally known as Colonial architecture. (See also: American Colonial Art.) This early architecture was as diverse as the settlers themselves, who included Spanish, English, Scots-Irish, Dutch, German, French and Swedish.
